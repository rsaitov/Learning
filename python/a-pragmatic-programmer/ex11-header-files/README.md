# Book: A Pragmatic Programmer
## Exercise 11: from Text Manipulation on page 102

Your C program uses an enumerated type to represent one of 100 states. Youâ€™d like to be able to print out the state as a string (as opposed to a number) for debugging purposes. Write a script that reads from standard input a file containing:
```
name
state_a
state_b
: :
```

Produce the file name.h, which contains:

```C
extern const char* NAME_names[];
typedef enum {
state_a,
state_b,
: :
} NAME;
```

and the file name.c, which contains:

```C
const char* NAME_names[] = {
"state_a",
"state_b",
: :
};
```
