# .NET 6 Minimal API by Les Jackson

Building of a .NET 6 minimal API to contrast and compare it with a MVC API to further understand the differences and similarities between them.

**Minimal APIs** are architected to create HTTP APIs with minimal dependencies. They are ideal for microservices and apps that want to include only the minimal files, features and dependencies in ASP.NET Core. 
(Microsoft Docs)

Minimal APIs don't have a controller (or use the MVC framework as a whole...)
- Don't support model validation.
- Don't support for JSONPatch.
- Don't support filters.
- Don't support custom model binding (support for IModelBinder).
**MVC**
- Software desing patter.
- Split program logic into three (interconnected) elements.
- Widely adopter in web development frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Spring (Java), Django (Python), ASP.NET MVC.
