# Dependency Injection

- DI is a Design Pattern
- Used predominantly in OOP
- Aims to allow us to develop "loosely-coupled" code
- With primary aim of making our code more maintainable

## What does it solve?
- We can swap implementation with ease
- We break the long dependency chains
- Unit testing becomes easier by removing direct dependencies and using an abstraction

## Commands
